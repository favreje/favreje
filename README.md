# Taking Notes


## Learn Markdown Basics

* What is Markdown and why do I care?
* Reduce all Markdown to **one best way**
----

### Headings
Headings begin with octothorpes (#). Include a blank line after the heading to to
create a new paragraph.

### Paragraphs
Paragraphs are separated by a carriage return.

### Indented text
```
This is indented (used for code blocks)
```

### Bullets
* bullet one
* bullit two

### In-line formatting
* Use *one star* for italics
* Use **two stars** for bold (strong).
* Use ***three stars*** for bold and italic (strong em).
* This is `monospace` (pre, preformatted, code.)
* Use dollar sign for in-line math $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$
